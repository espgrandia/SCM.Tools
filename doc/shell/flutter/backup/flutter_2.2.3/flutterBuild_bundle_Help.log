Build the Flutter assets directory from your app.

Global options:
-h, --help                  Print this usage information.
-v, --verbose               Noisy logging, including all shell commands executed.
                            If used with "--help", shows hidden options. If used with "flutter doctor", shows additional diagnostic information. (Use "-vv" to force verbose logging in those cases.)
-d, --device-id             Target device id or name (prefixes allowed).
    --version               Reports the version of this tool.
    --suppress-analytics    Suppress analytics reporting when this command runs.

Usage: flutter build bundle [arguments]
-h, --help                          Print this usage information.
    --[no-]tree-shake-icons         Tree shake icon fonts so that only glyphs used by the application remain.
                                    (defaults to on)
-t, --target=<path>                 The main entry-point file of the application, as run on the device.
                                    If the "--target" option is omitted, but a file name is provided on the command line, then that is used instead.
                                    (defaults to "lib/main.dart")
    --build-number                  An identifier used as an internal version number.
                                    Each build must have a unique identifier to differentiate it from previous builds.
                                    It is used to determine whether one build is more recent than another, with higher numbers indicating more recent build.
                                    On Android it is used as "versionCode".
                                    On Xcode builds it is used as "CFBundleVersion".
    --debug                         Build a debug version of your app (default mode).
    --profile                       Build a version of your app specialized for performance profiling.
    --release                       Build a release version of your app.
    --depfile                       A file path where a depfile will be written. This contains all build inputs and outputs in a Make-style syntax.
                                    (defaults to "build/snapshot_blob.bin.d")
    --target-platform               The architecture for which to build the application.
                                    [android-arm (default), android-arm64, android-x86, android-x64, ios, darwin-x64, linux-x64, linux-arm64, windows-x64]
    --asset-dir                     The output directory for the kernel_blob.bin file, the native snapshet, the assets, etc. Can be used to redirect the output when driving the Flutter toolchain from another build system.
                                    (defaults to "build/flutter_assets")
    --[no-]pub                      Whether to run "flutter pub get" before executing this command.
                                    (defaults to on)
    --[no-]track-widget-creation    Track widget creation locations. This enables features such as the widget inspector. This parameter is only functional in debug mode (i.e. when compiling JIT, not AOT).
                                    (defaults to on)

Run "flutter help" to see global options.
The Flutter assets directory contains your application code and resources; they are used by some Flutter Android and iOS runtimes.
