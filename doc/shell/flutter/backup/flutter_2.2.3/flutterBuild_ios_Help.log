Build an iOS application bundle (Mac OS X host only).

Global options:
-h, --help                  Print this usage information.
-v, --verbose               Noisy logging, including all shell commands executed.
                            If used with "--help", shows hidden options. If used with "flutter doctor", shows additional diagnostic information. (Use "-vv" to force verbose logging in those cases.)
-d, --device-id             Target device id or name (prefixes allowed).
    --version               Reports the version of this tool.
    --suppress-analytics    Suppress analytics reporting when this command runs.

Usage: flutter build ios [arguments]
-h, --help                          Print this usage information.
    --[no-]tree-shake-icons         Tree shake icon fonts so that only glyphs used by the application remain.
                                    (defaults to on)
    --split-debug-info=<v1.2.3/>    In a release build, this flag reduces application size by storing Dart program symbols in a separate file on the host rather than in the application. The value of the flag should be a directory where program symbol files can be stored for later use. These symbol files contain the information needed to symbolize Dart stack traces. For an app built with this flag, the "flutter symbolize" command with the right program symbol file is required to obtain a human readable stack trace.
                                    This flag cannot be combined with "--analyze-size".
    --debug                         Build a debug version of your app.
    --profile                       Build a version of your app specialized for performance profiling.
    --release                       Build a release version of your app (default mode).
-t, --target=<path>                 The main entry-point file of the application, as run on the device.
                                    If the "--target" option is omitted, but a file name is provided on the command line, then that is used instead.
                                    (defaults to "lib/main.dart")
    --flavor                        Build a custom app flavor as defined by platform-specific build setup.
                                    Supports the use of product flavors in Android Gradle scripts, and the use of custom Xcode schemes.
    --[no-]pub                      Whether to run "flutter pub get" before executing this command.
                                    (defaults to on)
    --build-number                  An identifier used as an internal version number.
                                    Each build must have a unique identifier to differentiate it from previous builds.
                                    It is used to determine whether one build is more recent than another, with higher numbers indicating more recent build.
                                    On Android it is used as "versionCode".
                                    On Xcode builds it is used as "CFBundleVersion".
    --build-name=<x.y.z>            A "x.y.z" string used as the version number shown to users.
                                    For each new version of your app, you will provide a version number to differentiate it from previous versions.
                                    On Android it is used as "versionName".
                                    On Xcode builds it is used as "CFBundleShortVersionString".
    --[no-]obfuscate                In a release build, this flag removes identifiers and replaces them with randomized values for the purposes of source code obfuscation. This flag must always be combined with "--split-debug-info" option, the mapping between the values and the original identifiers is stored in the symbol map created in the specified directory. For an app built with this flag, the "flutter symbolize" command with the right program symbol file is required to obtain a human readable stack trace.
                                    
                                    Because all identifiers are renamed, methods like Object.runtimeType, Type.toString, Enum.toString, Stacktrace.toString, Symbol.toString (for constant symbols or those generated by runtime system) will return obfuscated results. Any code or tests that rely on exact names will break.
    --dart-define=<foo=bar>         Additional key-value pairs that will be available as constants from the String.fromEnvironment, bool.fromEnvironment, int.fromEnvironment, and double.fromEnvironment constructors.
                                    Multiple defines can be passed by repeating "--dart-define" multiple times.
    --[no-]null-assertions          Perform additional null assertions on the boundaries of migrated and un-migrated code. This setting is not currently supported on desktop devices.
    --[no-]analyze-size             Whether to produce additional profile information for artifact output size. This flag is only supported on "--release" builds. When building for Android, a single ABI must be specified at a time with the "--target-platform" flag. When building for iOS, only the symbols from the arm64 architecture are used to analyze code size.
                                    This flag cannot be combined with "--split-debug-info".
    --[no-]config-only              Update the project configuration without performing a build. This can be used in CI/CD process that create an archive to avoid performing duplicate work.
    --[no-]simulator                Build for the iOS simulator instead of the device. This changes the default build mode to debug if otherwise unspecified.
    --[no-]codesign                 Codesign the application bundle (only available on device builds).
                                    (defaults to on)
